.dat files contain the tensor (spinning_flux_GR_chi09.dat) and the 
scalar (spinning_flux_charge_chi09.dat) fluxes.

The three columns in both files correspond to:
radius, spin parameter and flux value

The orbital radius is normalized to the primary mass, i.e. 
the values shown in the tables correspond to r/M.

Tensor and scalar fluxes are nomalized to q^2, with q=m/M.

The spin parameter has been sampled in a symmetric interval 
around chi = 0.9, chi = [0.89,0.91], while the radius has been 
sampled wih 100 values between r = 2.4 and r = 8.

Tensor (scalar) fluxes are summed over the multipole components 
from l = 2 (l=1) to l=10.
