flux_tensor.dat and flux_scalar.dat files contain the tensor fluxes in the format 

radius | spin parameter | flux value

The orbital radius is normalized to the primary mass, i.e. 
the values shown in the tables correspond to r/M.

Tensor and scalar fluxes are nomalized to q^2, with q=m/M.

The spin parameter has been sampled within chi ~ [0.01,0.99] with steps Delta chi = 0.01 
The radius is sampled starting from an uniform grid in 
u = ln(r - r_sep + 3.9) with u ~ [1.37, 3.82] and Delta_u = 0.05


Tensor (scalar) fluxes are summed over the multipole components 
from l = 2 (l=1) to l=10.
